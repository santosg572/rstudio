# Introduction to Freesurfer Output

In this
exercise, you will visualize and inspect correctly processed output data
so that you can become familiar with what the end product should look
like. The exercise will take you through a variety of output, but is
not necessarily the recommended procedure to take when trying to verify
each subject for a real study. Some outputs are only necessary to check
when troubleshooting, for example. However, it is a good idea for new
users to become familiar with the variety of outputs and how to view
them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Preparations

### If You're at an Organized Course

If you are
taking one of the formally organized courses, everything has been set up
for you on the provided laptop. The only thing you will need to do is
run the following commands in *every* **new** terminal window (aka shell) you open throughout this tutorial. Copy and paste the commands below to get started:

```         
export SUBJECTS_DIR=$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs
cd $SUBJECTS_DIR
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*To
copy: Highlight the command in the box above, right click and select
copy (or use keyboard shortcut Ctrl+c), then use the middle button of
your mouse to click inside the terminal window to paste (or use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+v).Press enter to run the command.* These two commands set the SUBJECTS_DIR
variable to the directory where the data is stored and then navigates
into this directory. You can now skip ahead to the tutorial (below the
gray line).

### If You're not at an Organized Course

If you are **NOT** taking one of the formally organized courses, then to follow this exercise exactly be sure you've downloaded the [tutorial data set](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/Data)
before you begin. If you choose not to download the data set you can
follow these instructions on your own data, but you will have to
substitute your own data paths and subject names. These are the commands
that you need to run before getting started:

```         
<source_freesurfer>
export TUTORIAL_DATA=<path_to_your_tutorial_data>
export SUBJECTS_DIR=$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs
cd $SUBJECTS_DIR
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Viewing Volumes with Freeview

With one
Freeview command line, you can load several output volumes, such as
brainmask.mgz and wm.mgz; the surfaces, rh.white and lh.white; and the
subcortical segmentation, aseg.mgz. Copy and paste the command below
inside the terminal window and press enter:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```         
freeview -v \
good_output/mri/T1.mgz \
good_output/mri/wm.mgz \
good_output/mri/brainmask.mgz \
good_output/mri/aseg.mgz:colormap=lut:opacity=0.2 \
-f good_output/surf/lh.white:edgecolor=blue \
good_output/surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=red \
good_output/surf/rh.white:edgecolor=blue \
good_output/surf/rh.pial:edgecolor=red
```

**NOTE**:
The backslash allows you to copy and paste multiple lines of code as
one command (otherwise, separating the command onto different lines
tells Linux they are different commands to be run separately). We use
the backslash throughout the tutorials to display the commands in a more
easy-to-read manner, while still allowing you to copy and paste. When
you are done with the course & do not need to copy and paste from
the tutorials, the backslash is not necessary to make the command work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes on the above command line:

-   good_output is the name of the subject

-   The flag -v is used to open some of the most commonly used volumes including:

    -   brainmask.mgz : skull-stripped volume primarily used for troubleshooting

    -   wm.mgz : white matter mask also used for troubleshooting

    -   aseg.mgz
        : subcortical segmentation loaded with its corresponding color table
        and at a low opacity. For more information on the subcortical
        segmentation, see [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/SubcorticalSegmentation).

-   The flag -f is used to load surfaces

    -   white & pial surfaces are loaded for each hemisphere & with color indicated by 'edgecolor'

After hitting enter, a Freeview window should open showing you the outputs you specified:

![good_output_slice128_crop_new.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=good_output_slice128_crop_new.png "good_output_slice128_crop_new.png"){alt="good_output_slice128_crop_new.png"} \

The menu on the left shows which files have been loaded.

Use the ![sliceoptions.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=sliceoptions.jpeg "sliceoptions.jpeg"){alt="sliceoptions.jpeg"}
buttons at the top to change which orthogonal view appears in the main
viewing window. Let's go with coronal for now. You can also use the ![viewingoptions.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=viewingoptions.jpeg "viewingoptions.jpeg"){alt="viewingoptions.jpeg"}
buttons to change the organization of the viewing panes. To change
which brain slice you are viewing, use the 'Page Up' or 'Page Down' keys
on your keyboard or the up and down arrows. (Mac users: press the fn
key while using the up and down arrows.)

While
Freeview can load many volumes at once, you cannot necessarily see them
all at once. You are able to see whichever volume is at the top of the
list in the menu on the left. An exception to this are volumes such as
the wm.mgz and aseg.mz which can be made translucent, allowing you to
view the information they contain simultaneously with the volume
directly below it on the list. For example, you are currently seeing
information from both the aseg (labeled structures) and the brainmask
(voxel intensities).

You
can hide or turn off a layer by unchecking the check box next to the
layer name. Try this out - uncheck the box next to 'aseg'. Now you can
see just the brainmask. You can also use the up and down arrows (located
below the menu on the left) to move the aseg down on the list, below
the brainmask (try it!). Let's now move the wm volume to the top of the
list but instead of using the arrows, try this shortcut: double click on
where it says 'wm'. It should automatically move to the top. The menu
should now look like this: \

![Menu.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Menu.png "Menu.png"){alt="Menu.png"} \

and the viewing window should look like this: \

![wm_mask.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=wm_mask.jpeg "wm_mask.jpeg"){alt="wm_mask.jpeg"}

-   **Keyboard Shortcut**:
    Alt+c will allow you to quickly cycle through all the layers. Every
    time you hit it, the volume at the top of the list will move to the
    bottom of the list. Mac users, all Freeview keyboard shortcuts are
    located [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/MacCommands).

When the Navigation button ![nav.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=nav.jpeg "nav.jpeg"){alt="nav.jpeg"}
is chosen, you can move the image in the viewing window around by
holding down the middle mouse button and dragging the mouse where you
want the image to go. Try it out. To zoom, scroll with the middle mouse
button. In this navigation mode, notice the cursor (little red
crosshair) moves to wherever you left click. When you change the
orientation (to axial or sagittal), you will be viewing the slice that
intersects with the cursor's location. To illustrate this point, if you
are in the viewing pane selected here:

![viewingoptions.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=viewingoptions.jpeg "viewingoptions.jpeg"){alt="viewingoptions.jpeg"}

You'll notice all the planes will shift based on where you move the cursor.

One
other important thing to note is that any action you do in the viewing
window (i.e. erasing, changing brightness, etc.) will take place on
whichever volume is currently highlighted in the left menu, regardless
of which file is at the top of the list.

Now
that you know the basics, you can make your way through the data. To
verify that FreeSurfer did a good job, you will want to check:

1.  Whether the surfaces accurately follow the gray matter and white matter boundaries.

2.  Whether the aseg accurately follows the subcortical intensity boundaries.

### Checking the Surfaces

Double
click on 'brainmask' in the left menu to bring it to the top of the
volume list. The white surface (blue line) is used to calculate total
white matter volume and should accurately follow the boundary between
white matter and gray matter. The pial surface (red line) is used to
calculate cortical gray matter volume and should accurately follow the
boundary between the gray matter and the CSF.

As
you scroll through the slices checking the surfaces for accuracy, keep
in mind that you are looking at a 2-dimensional rendering of a
3-dimensional image - be sure to look at more than just one view (i.e.,
sagittal, coronal and horizontal). You can turn the surfaces off and on
by checking and unchecking them in the left menu under where it says
'Surfaces'. As you do this, ask yourself: would you draw the boundary in
the same location?

-   **Keyboard Shortcut**: Alt+f will turn on and off whichever surface is highlighted in the menu window.

To
help verify accuracy, adjust the brightness and contrast so you can
easily identify the shift in intensity between gray and white matter. To
do this, left click on the image while holding down both the 'Shift'
key and the middle (scroll wheel) button on your mouse, and drag your
mouse. (Make sure the brainmask volume is highlighted in the left menu
in order for this to work.) The other way to do this is via the 'Window'
and 'Level' sliders underneath the left menu.

There are regions where the surfaces are not intended to be accurate that you should be aware of:

-   Areas
    around the hippocampus and amygdala. The surfaces will not completely
    include or exclude certain subcortical regions. These inaccuracies can
    be ignored as subcortical regions are excluded from the cortical
    measures and subcortical volume is measured by the aseg, not the
    surfaces.

    -   For an
        example of this, scroll to coronal slice 128 (slice numbers appear in
        the upper right hand corner of the viewing window).

### Subcortical Segmentation

Uncheck all
of the surfaces. Then check the box next to the aseg volume and double
click it. The aseg volume will jump to the top of the left menu, above
the brainmask volume. \

\

![good_output_5.3_sidebar_3.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=good_output_5.3_sidebar_3.png "good_output_5.3_sidebar_3.png"){alt="good_output_5.3_sidebar_3.png"} \

This will show the complete segmentation of the subcortical structures.

![good_output_nosurf.jpg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=good_output_nosurf.jpg "good_output_nosurf.jpg"){alt="good_output_nosurf.jpg"}

Each
structure is labeled with a unique color/number distinction. If you
click on a voxel the structure's name and number label will be shown in
the 'Cursor' section under the viewing window next to the word, 'aseg'.
If you hover over a voxel where the cursor is not located, the value of
that voxel will appear under the 'Mouse' section.

-   **Keyboard Shortcut**: Alt+v will turn on and off the layer that is currently highlighted.

Make
sure 'aseg' is highlighted in the left menu and press Alt+v to turn it
off and on. While doing this, make sure the aseg is accurately following
the underlying intensity boundaries of each structure. You can also
adjust the 'Opacity' slider to better see the underlying brainmask.

-   **Keyboard Shortcut**: Alt+a and Alt+s will change the opacity of the layer that is currently highlighted.

### Other Things To Do in Freeview

Below, we introduce you to other volumes and techniques which are good to be familiar with, especially when troubleshooting.

#### Skull Strip

Close the
aseg. As you scroll through the brainmask volume, notice that there is
no skull left in your image. You should also not see any regions of
cortex or cerebellum missing from this volume. Bring the T1.mgz to the
top of the volume list and toggle between it and the brainmask.mgz
volume (Alt+v) to verify that the skullstrip has worked properly. In the
[TroubleshootingData](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/TroubleshootingData) tutorial, we'll go over what to do if there was a skull strip error.

#### Intensity Normalization

Scroll
through the brainmask volume and notice that the intensity is uniform
throughout. You should not see any very bright or very dark spots in
the white matter or gray matter. If you click on a voxel in the white
matter, you can see that it has been normalized to an intensity of (or
close to) 110 (look under the Cursor section next to where it says
'brainmask'). When wm voxels are far from a value of 110, they may be
erroneously excluded from the white surface. By "close to," we mean wm
voxels have an intensity value of somewhere between 100 and 110. By "far
from," we mean wm voxels are between a value of 85 and 100. In the [TroubleshootingData](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/TroubleshootingData) tutorial, we'll go over what to do if there is an intensity normalization error.

#### WM Volume

Recheck all
of the surfaces and then double click on the wm volume to bring it to
the top of the list. This volume is FreeSurfer's initial segmentation of
the white matter (shown in gray) with additions from the automatic
topology fixer (in white). This "mask" is the starting point for the
white surface which grows out from here and stops at a more accurate
location using the intensity gradients in the brainmask.mgz volume as a
guide. The wm.mgz can be used to add missing wm voxels or delete voxels
that are not white matter but were included in the surface. In the [TroubleshootingData](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/TroubleshootingDataV6.0)
tutorial, we'll go over how to do this and when. For now, it will be
good to learn how to change the wm mask to a heat overlay for ease of
editing. The "heat" setting is used for editing because it allows us to
be able to see the underlying anatomy, while still being able to locate
inaccuracies in the wm.mgz "mask." You can also use 'Jet' overlay, if
you prefer. With wm highlighted in the left menu, take a look at the
options next to Color Map and choose 'Heat' or 'Jet'. Then adjust the
opacity so you can also see the brainmask underneath (down to around
0.20). It should look like this:

![Good_Output_Heat.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Good_Output_Heat.png "Good_Output_Heat.png"){alt="Good_Output_Heat.png"}

This could have also be done via commandline when first loading the wm in Freeview if we used this command: freeview -v wm.mgz:colormap=heat:opacity=0.25 brainmask.mgz (**Note: You don't need to run this command.**)

You can now close Freeview by hitting the **X** on the display window or Ctrl-q.

## Viewing Surfaces in 3D using Freeview

We're now
going to view several surface overlays. You could view the volumes
discussed above and the overlays discussed below all in one Freeview
session. They are separated in this tutorial only for simplicity. The
examples below are displayed only on the left hemisphere, however, you
could also view just the right hemisphere or both hemispheres at the
same time. Here are some surfaces you can look at with Freeview:

-   pial, white and inflated surface

-   sulcal and curvature maps

-   thickness maps

-   cortical parcellation

You can load them all in Freeview with the command below (be patient while they all load):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```         
freeview -f  good_output/surf/lh.pial:annot=aparc.annot:name=pial_aparc:visible=0 \
good_output/surf/lh.pial:annot=aparc.a2009s.annot:name=pial_aparc_des:visible=0 \
good_output/surf/lh.inflated:overlay=lh.thickness:overlay_threshold=0.1,3::name=inflated_thickness:visible=0 \
good_output/surf/lh.inflated:visible=0 \
good_output/surf/lh.white:visible=0 \
good_output/surf/lh.pial \
--viewport 3d
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes on the above command line:

-   lh.pial:annot=aparc.annot loads the Desikan-Killiany cortical parcellation on the pial surface. lh.pial:annot=aparc.a2009s.annot loads the Destrieux cortical parcellation on the pial surface.

    -   :name=pial_aparc:visible=0 changes which name shows up in the menu display and turns off this layer

-   lh.inflated:overlay=lh.thickness:overlay_threshold=0.1,3 loads the thickness overlay on top of the inflated surface and sets the min and max thresholds to display

**Pial Surface**\

The first volume you see is the pial surface. The pial surface here is
the full 3D representation of the red surface you saw on each 2D slice
of the brainmask volume, earlier in the tutorial. The green regions are
gyri and the red regions are sulci. With this surface, the sulci are
mostly hidden. Feel free to move the inflated brain around by left
clicking on it and dragging the mouse. If you would like to put the
brain back to its original state, go to **View \> Reset View**, press Ctrl+r, or click the Reset button: ![ResetButton.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ResetButton.png "ResetButton.png"){alt="ResetButton.png"}

![lh.pial.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=lh.pial.jpeg "lh.pial.jpeg"){alt="lh.pial.jpeg"}

To
get rid of the yellow lines being displayed on the surface
(corresponding to the 3 slice views), right-click on the surface and
check Hide All Slices, or hit Crtl+Shift+s.

**White Surface**\

Press Alt+c to cycle to the white surface.

![lh.white.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=lh.white.jpeg "lh.white.jpeg"){alt="lh.white.jpeg"}

The
white surface shows the boundary between white matter and gray matter.
It is the 3D representation of the blue surface you saw on the 2D slices
of the brainmask. With this surface, we are able to see the sulci a bit
better. You can inspect this surface by rotating it around as you wish.

**Inflated Surface**\

Press Alt+c to cycle to the curvature on the inflated surface. With the
inflated surface, you can fully see the sulci. If you look at the
options next to 'Curvature' in the left menu pane, you can switch it to
binary to see the curvature in grayscale. Or switch it to 'off' to see
the smooth inflated surface.

![lh.curv.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=lh.curv.jpeg "lh.curv.jpeg"){alt="lh.curv.jpeg"}

The
inflated surface can be helpful to find bumps, holes, or other defects
that may need to be corrected. If you click on the inflated surface, you
will see the coordinates of the vertex you clicked on in the 'Cursor'
window.

**Thickness Map**\

Press Alt+c to cycle to the thickness map on the inflated surface.

![lh_thick.jpeg](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=lh_thick.jpeg "lh_thick.jpeg"){alt="lh_thick.jpeg"}

**Cortical Parcellation**\

Press Alt+c to cycle to the cortical parcellations. On the left is the
Desikan-Killiany parcellation and on the right is the Destrieux
parcellation.

![good_output_aparc_crop.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=good_output_aparc_crop.png "good_output_aparc_crop.png"){alt="good_output_aparc_crop.png"} ![DestrieuxAtlas.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=DestrieuxAtlas.png "DestrieuxAtlas.png"){alt="DestrieuxAtlas.png"}

Click
on a color and view the name of the cortical region in the 'Cursor' or
'Mouse' windows next to where it says 'aparc.annot'. Rotate the brain so
you are looking at the medial wall. Notice that all subcortical gray
matter is not a part of the surface labels (because again, those areas
do not count towards the cortical surface measures).

By
default there are two parcellations that are made when recon-all is
run. The two parcellations are the ?h.aparc.annot, created with the
Desikan-Killiany atlas, and the ?h.aparc.a2009s.annot, created with the
Destrieux atlas. The difference is the number and designation of the
areas that are labeled. You can load the Destrieux parcellation by
clicking on the drop down box next to 'Annotation' on the left panel and
choosing **Load from file...**. Browse to lh.aparc.a2009s.annot and hit 'Open'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should know:

-   How to visualize and inspect FreeSurfer data

-   The command to visualize data in Freeview

-   What
    to look for when visualizing data including that surfaces follow the
    gray and white matter boundaries and that the aseg.mgz accurately
    follows the subcortical intensity boundaries

-   The
    regions around the hippocampus and amygdala are not intended to be
    accurate and these inaccuracies can be ignored as subcortical regions
    are excluded from cortical measures

-   Surfaces
    can be viewed in 3D such as the pial, white, and inflated surfaces,
    sulcul and cortical maps, thickness maps, and cortical parcellation.

This
tutorial was meant as an introduction to Freeview. For information on
buttons or menu options not covered here, you can find out about them on
the [FreeviewGuide](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeviewGuide) wiki.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 1

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Goal:** Practice basic Freeview tasks.

In
the examples above you looked at data from a subject called
“good_output”. For this challenge complete the following tasks for
subject “004”.

1.  Open the subject’s aparc+aseg.mgz volume with a colormap of “lut”.

2.  Swap the view to sagittal

3.  Navigate with the arrow keys to find the right putamen

*Need a hint?*

-   Here is how you opened up a similar volume for the “good_output” subject:  freeview -v good_output/mri/aseg.mgz:colormap=lut 

-   Please note that we were in the \$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs directory when we used that command - so  cd  there if you'd like to base your command off the above example.

Want to know the answer? Click and drag to highlight and reveal the text below.

|     |                                                  |     |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------|-----|
|     |  cd \$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs  |     |
|     |                                                  |     |
|     | freeview -v 004/mri/aparc+aseg.mgz:colormap=lut  |     |
|     |                                                  |     |

### Exercise 2

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Goal:** Practice visualizing data with overlays.

1.  Open 004’s lh.pial surface, with the overlay named lh.thickness, set the overlay to display with a threshold of 1,2

2.  Look up vertex 141813

3.  What is the thickness of this vertex?

*Need a hint?*

-   Here is how you opened up a similar surface for the good_output subject, with thickness information:  freeview -f good_output/surf/lh.inflated:overlay=lh.thickness:overlay_threshold=0.1,3 --viewport 3d 

-   And here is how you opened up a similar surface for the good_output subject with the Desikan-Killany parcellation:  freeview -f  good_output/surf/lh.pial:annot=aparc.annot 

-   Please note that we were in the \$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs directory when we used that command - so  cd  there if you'd like to base your command off the above example.

Want to know the answer? Click and drag to highlight and reveal the text below.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
|  |  cd \$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | freeview -f 004/surf/lh.pial:overlay=lh.thickness:overlay_threshold=1,2 --viewport 3d |  |
|  |  |  |

### Exercise 3

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Goal:** Practice opening multiple files at a time with [FreeView](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeView).

-   For this challenge start with this terminal command:

 freeview -v 004/mri/wm.mgz:colormap=jet 004/mri/brainmask.mgz -f 004/surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=blue 004/surf/lh.white:edgecolor=red 

-   Right
    now it only opens the left hemisphere pial and white matter surfaces,
    alter it to open both for the right hemisphere as well, with colors that
    match the left hemisphere side.

-   Once
    you have the last command working, rearrange the volume layers in
    freesurfer so that the wm.mgz is at %20 opacity and the brainmask can be
    seen underneath it (this can also be done through altering the terminal
    command - you can choose which way to do so).

-   You will need to be in \$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs for the command to work, so cd there if needed

Want the solution? Click and drag to highlight and reveal the text below.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
|  |  cd \$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs |  |
|  |  |  |

004/surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=blue 004/surf/lh.white:edgecolor=red 
004/surf/rh.pial:edgecolor=blue 004/surf/rh.white:edgecolor=red |  |
|  |  |  |

### Exercise 4

**Difficulty:** Intermediate - assumes some comfort with navigating Unix and [FreeView](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeView)

**Goal:** Export a series of images from [FreeView](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeView) and stitch them together to create a GIF.

1.  Open up any surface from the tutorial data

2.  Set the viewport to 3d view, right click in the viewport and select  Hide All Slices 

3.  In the  File  menu, select  Save Movie Frames 

4.  Set
    up the options as in the following picture - you will need to create a
    new directory in the /home/developer/tutorial_data directory to save the
    output to. ![MovieSetup.png](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=MovieSetup.png "MovieSetup.png"){alt="MovieSetup.png"}

5.  Select 'Write' once you have set up the options and created a new directory for your gif

6.  In a terminal, navigate to the new directory you output the movie data to.

7.  Run this command:  convert -delay .1 \*.png brainanim.gif 

    -   Note: convert is from the [ImageMagick](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/ImageMagick) library, this is setup on the course computers. If you are doing the tutorials from home you can get a copy of [ImageMagick](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/ImageMagick) here <https://imagemagick.org/index.php>

    -    -delay  determines the gap between frames,  \*.png  selects all png files in the working directory,  brainanim.gif  is the output name.

8.  To view your GIF, open it with firefox  firefox brainanim.gif
