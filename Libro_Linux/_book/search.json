For instance, if you forget to include -type f in a search for empty files, you get directories in your results. By adding a delete flag, you would remove potentially important directory structures.\nIt’s vital to compose your find command and then verify the results before deleting. Furthermore, a misplaced delete flag in find can delete results before qualifying them (in other words, you can delete directories in a command intended to delete only files by placing the delete flag before the type flag).\nI prefer to use xargs or Parallel and a trash command on the rare occasion that I remove files with find."
